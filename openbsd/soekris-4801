It's ancient hardware with a mere 128 megabytes of RAM and a deathly slow 233 MHz Geode CPU, but the venerable Soekris 4801 can still be of utility.

A Soekris 4801 running OpenBSD can still perform innumerable functions: a serial console server, recursive DNS, a lightweight monitoring server and so on. OpenBSD is an ideal choice since it can be built small and lean, yet contains impressive functionality in the base without installing any third-party software.

These instructions apply to OpenBSD/i386 installation with the stable version which is located in pub/OpenBSD/N.N/i386.

Using any type of bootstrap computer, boot from install$V.fs (where V=current OpenBSD stable version). Once the prompt is reached,

(i) install (u) upgrade

plug in the CF card adapter and note the device name, which in this case is sd2.

Begin the install process to sd2

Just install bsd, bsd.rd and base$V.tgz

-bsd.mp
-comp*
-game*
-man*
-x*

The default install will cease when booting at the line:

entry point at 0x200120

It is necessary to configure serial console access:

/etc/ttys

	tty00	"/usr/libexec/getty std.9600"	unknown off

to

	tty00	"/usr/libexec/getty std.9600"	vt220	on secure

/etc/boot.conf

	set tty com0

Depending on the role of the device, some of the default startup daemons can be disabled.

/etc/rc.conf.local

sndiod_flags=NO
smtpd_flags=NO

What is more beautiful than a top(1) display with a mere handful of processes running?
