Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks

The weapon of choice on the internet battlefield is the distributed denial of service attack (DDoS).

It's "distributed" insofar at the attack originates with multiple, if not thousands, of hosts.

It's a "denial of service" as the attacking hosts, most usually compromised home computers, are "requesting" services provided by the target host, be it a web site, email server, and so on.

It must first be understood that a large DDoS attack can't just be stopped easily. The amount of bandwidth consumed can overwhelm even a firm like Google or Yahoo. Readers of this piece likely maintain negligible infrastructures in comparison, likely a virtual private server or two, or maybe a server or two in a data center or office.
