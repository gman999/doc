Towards a Better Training Framework

* strong understanding of trainees and their context

* pre-training questionnaire

****

* trainee scenario and their threat model: the Socratic method

* what are they doing now to mitigate issues

* rework threat modeling, and give it terms, a glossary, and breakdown

* how to do generic technical things
	create strong memorable passwords
	lookup whois data
	review an SSL certificate
	minimize phone and computer software footprint

* how relevant things work: DNS, SMTP, HTTP/S, proxies

* and then maybe tools
