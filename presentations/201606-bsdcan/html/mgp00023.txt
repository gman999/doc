Again: Is Tor the Perfect Solution? 


No.  Tor could be compromised by an adversary with a full global network view, watching critical flows, sitting on backbone routers

No.  What about Linux RNG and other lowest-common denominators

We shouldn't be encouraging delusions about any bullet-proof solutions

it's about mitigation, relative strength versus
particular adversaries in particular contexts
